# Stock Price Prediction Using Deep Learning 

* Univariate Time Series

Predicting stock price using historical data of a company using Neural networks for multi-step forecasting of stockÂ price.

# General info
This project is; to implement deep learning algorithms two sequential models of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as stacked LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and NeuralProphet built with PyTorch to predict stock prices using time series forecasting.

# Disclaimer
Attempts have been made to predict stock prices using time series analysis algorithms, but they are not yet available for betting in the real market. This is just a tutorial and implementation of deep learning models to forecast stock. Therefore, it is not intended to instruct people to buy stock from this publishing.
